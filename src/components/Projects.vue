                This was my third year university project where I built an IoT web app in Go and Javascript. 
                The backend received JSON from an ES8266 wifi device connected to an arduino and outputted the 
                JSON to a dynamically rendered table. This table data was also hidden behind a login
                using cookie authentication.

                This project was when I discovered how fascinating backend development is. I learned a lot 
                and I am passionate about learning more about backend development
